```
-b filename     block special file
-c filename     special character file
-d dirname      check for directory existence
-e filename     check for file existence
-f filename     check for regular file existence not a directory
-G filename     check if file exists and is owned by effective group ID.
-g filename     true if file exists and is set-group-id.
-k filename     sticky bit
-L filename     symbolic link
-O filename     true if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.
-r filename     check if file is a readable
-S filename     check if file is socket
-s filename     check if file is nonzero size
-u filename     check if file set-user-id bit is set
-w filename     check if file is writable
-x filename     check if file is executable
-z <string> ... true if the length of the string is non-zero
```

__example__
```sh
#!/bin/bash
file=./file
if [ ! -e "$file" ]; then
  echo "File does not exist"
else
  echo "File exists"
fi
```

## Pipe stdout to multiple commands
```sh
$ cat file.txt | tee >(pbcopy) >(do_stuff) >(do_more_stuff) | grep errors
```

## Find and replace in multiple files
```sh
$ ag -l <pattern> | xargs sed -i '' -E 's/<old>/<new>/g'
```

## Delete a range of lines
```
$ cat file.txt | sed -e '1,2d'
```

## Manipulate columns with awk
```sh
$ cat file.txt | awk '{$3=$1; gsub(/0[12345]_/, "", $3); $2="|"}{print}'
```

## Check for value, fill in if it doesn't exist
```sh
$ screen_width=${COLUMNS:-$(tput cols)}
```

## Connect to ssh server
```sh
ssh -i <path/to/file> <name>@<ip>
```
or with a `~/.ssh/configfile`
```
ssh <Host>
```

## list all open files for user
```sh
lsof -u <ownername>
```

## named pipes / inter-shell communication
Named pipes are cool to create background processes with that can be addressed
by name to do stuff with. It creates a physical file on the system that can be
used from any shell process. The code below passes the output of `pipe` to
`cat`, which then writes to `out.txt`. When passing in a command to `pip`
(`ls -la` in this case), it pops back out at the other side.
```sh
$ mkfifo pipe
$ cat < pipe > output.ext
$ ls -la > pipe
```

## follow logs as they grow
```sh
$ tail -r <file>
```

## execute a command in npm module dir
```txt
npm ex <module name> <command> ... execute a command in the module dir
```

## dig
DNS lookup utility
```sh
# example
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5000 something.foo +short
1.1.1.1
```

## vifm
